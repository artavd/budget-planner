# Budget Planner - the application for long-term personal budget planning

The application idea based on the self-prepared spreadsheet, which I've been using to make long-term (> 1 year) family finances planning for several years. Most of the features that are going to be implemented in the first versions are migrated directly from this spreadsheet to make my budget planning more fast and comfortable.

## Wanted features
* Budget Periods
  * Split the finance plan into short manageable periods of time (i.e. periods between regular finance incomes - from salary till salary).
  * Populate period with planned expences.
  * Automatically calculate the closing balance for period base on previous closing balance and planned expences.
  * Ability to override closing balance for any period with real value.
  * Re-calculation of future period balances after adding new planned expense.

* Analytics
  * Highlight periods with negative outcomes (closing balance is less than opening).
  * Profit / Loss trends.
  * Categories of planned expence and diagram for chosen period of time.
  
* Unplanned expenses
  * Wishes or goals which are not fit to current budget but should be tracked.
  * Calculation of the total budget for unplanned expenses.
  * Advices for planning of unplanned expences (based on specified estimations / deadlines for them).
